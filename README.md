This is the system I use to TDD my UIAlertView and UIActionSheet code.

The example project includes two versions of the tests: one in plain OCUnit, and
one using OCHamcrest. OCHamcrest is not required â€” but compare the test code
(especially checking the `otherButtonTitles` NSArray) and you'll see why I
prefer it.
