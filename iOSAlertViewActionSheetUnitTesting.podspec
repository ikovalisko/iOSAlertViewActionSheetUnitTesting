  Ever wonder if it's possible to write unit tests for alerts and action sheets?
  This is the system I use to TDD my UIAlertView and UIActionSheet code.

  The example project includes two versions of the tests: one in plain OCUnit, and
  one using [OCHamcrest](https://github.com/hamcrest/OCHamcrest). OCHamcrest is
  not required â€” but compare the test code (especially checking the
  `otherButtonTitles` NSArray) and you'll see why I prefer it.

  For more discussion, see my blog post
  [Unit Testing Your Alerts and Action Sheets](http://qualitycoding.org/testing-alerts/).
